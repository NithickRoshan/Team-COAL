We have the highest unsheltered homeless population in the nation, and this number continues to grow. Santa Clara County spends over $520 million a year on the homeless crisis, but existing solutions are insufficient. As San Jose City Council members, you have the power to help the homeless find homes. \\n  \\nBusiness Proposals, Spring 2022.  3 of 6  Our Hi-Tech Rovers will bring much-needed resources directly to the homeless. These Rovers have the potential to save the city government millions of dollars per year while improving the lives of our city\\u2019s most vulnerable residents. We have already experienced a great deal of success, having helped thousands of homeless people in San Jose. With the support of the City Council, we can reach even more people who desperately need our help. Problem Statement  Show your potential customer that you understand the problem they are facing. You should know all about the problem from your extensive research. Use facts and emotional appeals to craft a persuasive argument that their problem needs to be solved. Be detailed, but only include directly relevant information.  Abridged Problem Statement Example Homelessness in San Jose is rampant and on the rise. Over 11,515 homeless people were living in San Jose in 2020. The number of homeless people increased by 89% from the 6,097 reported in the 2019 Homeless Census & Survey and 165% from the 4,350 reported in the 2017 Homeless Census & Survey. One out of every hundred people living in San Jose is homeless, and for every person housed, two more become homeless. If nothing changes, this trend will continue. These homeless people are more than just statistics. They are our friends, family members, and neighbors who need our help. Homelessness is degrading and dangerous. Homeless people are more likely to  \\u2022 contract contagious diseases such as COVID-19, \\u2022 have minor injuries turn life threatening due to a lack of health care, \\u2022 develop an addiction to deadly drugs, \\u2022 suffer from mental illness, \\u2022 and be victims of violence. Our founder, Stephen Graham, lost three brothers to homelessness. He knows firsthand what a serious problem homelessness is and how imperative it is that we address it. Proposed Solution  This will likely be the longest part of your business proposal. You want to convince your potential customer that you have the best solution to their problem. Describe your solution, how it will benefit your potential customer, and how you will implement it. Address any concerns your potential customer may have. Explain the details of your proposed solution clearly and accurately. Do not shy away from including technical information, as your target audience now includes technical evaluators and specialists who do not require the simplified language you used in your executive summary.   \\n  \\nBusiness Proposals, Spring 2022.  4 of 6  Abridged Proposed Solution Example Our Hi-Tech Rovers are a novel solution to the homelessness crisis. They are 30-foot customized vehicles that bring much-needed resources directly to the homeless. You can find our Hi-Tech Rovers serving our most vulnerable citizens at parks, churches, and homeless encampments.  Hi-Tech Rovers provide \\u2022 first aid; \\u2022 counseling; \\u2022 access to Wi-Fi, computers, and printers; \\u2022 assistance with job and housing searches; \\u2022 clothing, showers, and grooming stations. Homeless people no longer need to jump through hoops and trek across the city for the chance to access the resources that they so desperately need. The Hi-Tech Rover has shifted the paradigm by bringing an abundance of resources to the homeless rather than expecting the homeless to find and compete for scarce resources. The Hi-Tech Rover is effective, efficient, and compassionate. We meet people where they are and help them get to where they want to be. Qualifications  You must convince your potential customer that you are able to solve their problem. Establish the credentials of your company. Inform your potential customer about your relevant expertise and accomplishments. Consider using testimonials from previous customers and case studies demonstrating your success.   Qualifications Example We are a Silicon Valley based non-profit that uses innovative approaches to help the homeless transform their lives. Our Hi-Tech Rovers have already reached and helped thousands of homeless people. Last year, we helped 400 homeless people find permanent housing. We are listed on the Service Provider Network in Santa Clara County, 211.org, and the City of SJ homeless resource guide. We also enjoy the support of San Jose State University and Adobe, both of which provide us with volunteers. Our strong ties to the community uniquely position us to understand and provide for the needs of homeless people in San Jose. Timeline Include a timeline so that your potential customer knows how long it will take you to implement your proposed solution. Be as specific and realistic as possible. Consider using graphics to display your timeline.  Pricing Include a realistic and detailed breakdown of costs. Make sure that your pricing structure is clear, so your potential customer knows what they are paying for. Use tables and graphs to display your pricing data. Consider including an analysis that shows the return on investment your potential customer can expect.  \\n  \\nBusiness Proposals, Spring 2022.  5 of 6  Terms and Conditions  This section lets your potential customer know what is expected of both parties should they accept your proposal. This part is, in effect, a contract. Thoroughly cover billing procedures, project scope, and other legal aspects of the deal. Your company may have a boilerplate agreement that you can use. Keep in mind that these terms may be modified during negotiations. Consider consulting a lawyer when working on this part of your business proposal. Agreement  If a proposal doesn\\u2019t lead to an agreement to do work together, then the proposal has failed. Make it as easy as possible for your potential customer to accept your proposal. Include space for your potential customer to sign. Like the terms and conditions, this part is, in effect, a contract.

It is not tailored to needs of the potential customer. It fails to identify a problem, offer a solution, or convey why they should implement the solution. Instead, it makes vague and self-indulgent claims. It also uses confusing technical jargon \\u201cACH\\u201d and \\u201cSWIFT\\u201d and includes a typo, \\u201cinitiative\\u201d instead of \\u201cinitiate.\\u201d     \\n  \\nBusiness Proposals, Spring 2022.  6 of 6  Activity 2: Respond to Prompts Respond to the following prompts asking you to create parts of business proposals.   \\u2022 Design a title page for a proposal selling first-aid equipment to the United States Navy. Design a different title page for a proposal selling organic paint to an arts festival.  \\u2022 Write an executive summary for a proposal to put your vegan restaurant in San Jose State University\\u2019s dining commons. \\u2022 Think of something that bothers you and write an abridged problem statement about it.
